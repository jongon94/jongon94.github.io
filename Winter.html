	       <h1>Winter</h1>
         <p>A colder time that some love and others hate</p>
 <p>
During the winter months the current year ends and a new year starts. The days are shorter and often very cold. Sometimes the precipitation will fall as sleet and snow, and quite often we wake up in the morning to frost and ice on the floor. Winter is usually cold and wet, however it does differ in other parts of the world.</p>
