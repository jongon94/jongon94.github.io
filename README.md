 Hey Guys,
	
	1.	Please copy and paste the html in the "index.html"file.
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------	
It is a base to start with.
And more importantly a basic menu. It should hopefully, attach all of our pages together

Hi Guys,
I have added a folder for our pictures.
Please place them there.
	In case you don't remember how to map the images:
	
Use this command and remember to change picture name to match your own.
HTML:
	<img src="pixs/PictureName.jpg">
	
CSS:
	body{background-image:url(pixs/PictureName.jpg);}
	
Have a good weekend, IR

Yo New update!!
Fixed the menu, it is NOW somewhat responsive to the size of the browser.
I recommend that we follow in Mitchel's footsteps and put everything under the "center" elements. Example: <center> blah blah </center>
I also added a little code to all of our head part: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
so don't delete it, we need it.
