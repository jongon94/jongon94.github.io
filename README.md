 Hey Guys,
	
	1.	Please copy and paste the html in the "index.html"file.
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------	
It is a base to start with.
And more importantly a basic menu. It should hopefully, attach all of our pages together

Hi Guys,
I have added a folder for our pictures.
Please place them there.
	In case you don't remember how to map the images:
	
Use this command and remember to change picture name to match your own.
HTML:
	<img src="pixs/PictureName.jpg">
	
CSS:
	body{background-image:url(pixs/PictureName.jpg);}
	
Have a good weekend, IR
